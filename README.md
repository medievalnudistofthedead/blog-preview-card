## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using what I learned from the last project I was able to utilize flex without any real issue.

### Continued development

I'm still manually having to tweak padding and margins for small things and I don't know yet if that's just how it is or if that's something that will improve as I learn more.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
